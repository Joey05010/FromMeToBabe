    <P class="passage">My  celebrity  crush turned girlfriend who i adore so so much, i love talking to you and spending time being with you, minutes can turn to hours without us even noticing, being ble to hold your hand feels so right and comforting, i find myself getting lost in your eyes and honestly not wanting to every get found.
        <br>

        Your heart is one so pure and gentle, your caring and loving nature  is so genuine it just radiates of you and it's what draw me to you.
        <br>
        </br>
        I love your voice , your eyes, your attitude(although you say  you don't have one), your lips, your face, your heart, your intelligence, your heart for your family and Friends , Your Love for God, YOU. </P>
